/*One of the most useful features of Rust is the concept of ownership. This is how Rust achieves memory safety.
The basic gist is as follows. If you have an object of a type that does not support the copy trait then the 
following line of code would leave v unusable:

let v = vec![1,2,3,4,5];
let v2 = v;

here v2 would have ownership over our funny little vector and v would have been left dead. This is to stop dataraces
from happening. This is crucial behaviour in Rust. Types such as bool and i32 have the copy trait which allows
the above assignment to work, but what happens over the hood is that v2 receives ownership of a COPY of v while
v retain the ownership of the original copy. Naturally we can move ownership back and forth like:

let v = vec![1,2,3,4,5];
let v2 = v;
let v = v2;

However this gets cumbersome and hence has another very important feature called borrowing.

Borrowing is handled using references (much like pointers). Consider the following code:

fn doStuff(v1: Vec<i32>, v2: Vec<i32>){
	do stuff here.
}

If the above function is given two vectors it gains ownership over them as we've seen earlier. However, we can
pass references to the vectors as follows without taking away ownership:

fn doStuff(v1: &Vec<i32>, v2: &Vec<i32>){
	do stuff here.
}

This is called borrowing. However these references are unmutable meaning that we can't actually change the two
vectors in any way, just look at them. Naturally there are exceptions to this, namely the &mut refrence. Consider
the following code:

fn doStuff(v1: &mut vec<i32>, v2: &mut vec<i32>){
	do stuff here.
}

Here we can actually change the values in the two vectors. The bellow code does just this:

*/


fn testBorrow(v1: &mut Vec<i32>, v2: &mut Vec<i32>){
	v1[2] = 2;
	v2[2] = 2;
}


/*

There are rules to follow when making use of references and mutable references: you can either have 

1) one more more references (using the normal "&" marking; ex: &Vec<i32>) to a resource.
OR
2) you can have exactly one mutable reference (using "&mut" marking; ex: &mut Vec<i32>) to a resource.

Essentially this means that you can have an arbitrary number of references that are read only but ever only one
reference if that reference can both read and write. 

Another important rule is that the scope of the borrow must not be greater than the scope of the owner.
Borrowing is tied to the scope and as such when we borrow the borrow last until the end of the scope it
is borrowed in. This means that
